# RhoActinRD (Rho and actin reaction-diffusion)

This repository contains the Matlab code for the publication
1. "Actin network heterogeneity tunes activator-inhibitor dynamics at the cell cortex," by O. Maxian, A. Dinner, and E. Munro, July 2025. 

The main code can be found in [https://github.com/omaxian/RhoActinRD/blob/master/RhoAndActin/MakeMoviesBestFit.m](RhoAndActin/MakeMoviesBestFit.m). This will generate Fig. 2 in the paper (all of the simulations best fit to the experimental data). Continuum model codes can be found in RhoAndActin/ContinuumModel
