# RhoActinRD (Rho and actin reaction-diffusion)

This repository contains the Matlab code for the publication
1. "Actin network heterogeneity tunes activator-inhibitor dynamics at the cell cortex," by O. Maxian, A. Dinner, and E. Munro, July 2025. 

The main code can be found [here](https://github.com/omaxian/RhoActinRD/blob/master/RhoAndActin/MakeMoviesBestFit.m) This will generate Fig. 2 in the paper (all of the simulations best fit to the experimental data), and more generally is the interface for the discrete model coupling actin filaments to continuum Rho dynamics. Codes for continuum model (Fig. 5 in the text) can be found [here](https://github.com/omaxian/RhoActinRD/blob/master/RhoAndActin/ContinuumModels/RhoAndActinTauPDEs.m)
